            Education is the backbone of any country and for a developing
            country like Bangladesh, overseas education is even more important
            because of the higher standard of education, better and dedicated
            teachers, better facilities and upto date curriculums and study
            materials. Thus making them more utilizable.
            <br /> 
            <br />
            We are an experienced student recruitment firm. Our services include
            accurately advising about the institutes we represent and about the
            courses they teach. We make no exaggerations and do not attempt to
            mislead. We have no charges but individual institutes have their own
            terms and conditions and the terms of visas also differ from country
            to country. So we expect students to fully understand what we are
            offering them before committing themselves.
            <br /> 
            <br />
            Although not a very old recruitment firm, we are very experienced.
            Our managing partner was involved in the recruitment business from
            August 1998 as a founder partner of the Youth Education Service. He
            has, till date, recruited thousands of students for the UK, Ireland,
            Australia and Canada and we are proud to add that he has received
            several awards including the world’s top recruiter for a single
            institute in the UK, no less than three times, albeit not in
            consecutive years.
            <br /> 
            <br />
            We are extremely proud to have someone who has achieved the world’s
            top recruiter award at our helm not only because it proves that we
            can do better than our competitors in Bangladesh, but because it
            also proves that we try harder for you.
            <br /> 
            <br />
            Student Connection International have no sub agents, but we are
            represented by our branch offices in several cities. We hope to
            expand slowly but steadily into different cities and to hopefully
            one day offer students an opportunity to gain our advice and support
            locally.

              As a key player in this field we are known and loved by many. It
              makes us extremely happy when we are approached by some of our
              students who have successfully completed their studies and are
              doing well and are contributing towards our country. Even if we
              are sometimes unable to recognize many of them, we are very happy
              to be approached and to learn what benefits have been obtained
              from studies overseas.
